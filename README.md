# Mixed-Signal-Board----DOCUMENTS
The following content is covered in this course:

- Introduction
    Course overview, pre-requisites, overview of product we'll be designing.
- System-Level Design
  Requirements capture, basic and detailed system descriptions with block diagrams, design choices, part selection (power supplies, ICs, MCUs, connectors, etc.), how to read a datasheet, mechanical constraints.
- Circuit Design, Simulation, and Schematic Capture
     Datasheets, linear vs switching regulator, switching (buck) regulator design, LED calculations, power supply filtering, RC and RLC filters, microcontroller circuitry (STM32), pin assignment (STM32CubeIDE), decoupling capacitors, ESD protection, EMI/EMC 
     considerations, crystal oscillator design, USB circuitry and USB Type C, ADC/DAC circuitry, analogue front-end design (anti-aliasing filters, buffers, single-ended to differential conversion), simulation of analogue circuitry using LTSpice (free). Schematic tips and  
     tricks for readability. ERC (electrical rules check).
 - Symbol and Footprint Creation
    How to create good and easy-to-use symbols in KiCad and how to create good footprints for ICs in KiCad. Both via the aid of the datasheet. Adding 3D models to footprints.
 - PCB Design Essentials
    Stackups, manufacturing capabilites and design for manufacturing, layout and routing principles, return paths, vias and traces, copper pours, mechanical considerations.
  - PCB Layout and Routing
     Complete and real-time layout and routing of the four-layer PCB in KiCad 6. Setting up design rules in KiCad, setting up board stack-up, track widths, vias, controlled impedance trace calculation and routing, mechanical outline, mounting holes, connector placement, 
     component placement, sectioning, mixed-signal guidelines, EMC/EMI guidelines, silkscreen. Design rule check (DRC).
  - Getting Your Hardware Produced
     Generating files for manufacturing (Gerber) and assembly (assembly information, footprint positions, and bill of materials). Ordering process using generated files and cost estimation.  
  - Outro
    Final notes and tips, how to get certificate, and contact to instructor.
